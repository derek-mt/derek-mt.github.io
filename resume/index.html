<div class="section">
<strong>UIUC Parallel Programming Lab</strong> (June 2020 - Present)<br />
<div class="small">
Worked on <a href="https://github.com/paratreet/paratreet">ParaTreeT</a> (Parallel
Tree Toolkit), a framework for implementing tree-based parallel applications.
<ul>
<li>Refactored the framework to enable greater flexibility and versatility
in tree type/structure and domain decomposition.</li>
<li>Implemented parallel domain decomposition based on space-filling curves
for a Barnes-Hut N-Body simulation written with ParaTreeT.</li>
<li>Gathered extensive performance data and wrote detailed documentation on the
code structure and organization of the project.</li>
</ul>

<div class="small">
Office Hour Captain <em>(August 2019 - May 2020)</em>
<ul>
<li>Coordinated office hours for a class of ~900 students and ~100 Course Assistants.</li>
<li>Held ~10 office hours per week to help students with assignments and answer questions.</li>
<li>Organized and conducted Course Assistant Training to make office hours more effective and efficient.</li>
</ul><br />
Course Developer <em>(January 2019 - May 2020)</em>
<ul>
<li>Developed <a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/jtrace">jtrace</a>, a JVM native agent
 that traces program state, and <a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/java-complexity">java-complexity</a>,
 a static code analysis tool that calculates cyclomatic complexity. Used to gather data on
 student homework submissions.</li>
<li>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/janini">janini</a>, an online Java execution platform
 designed for educational use.</li>
<li>Held ~4 office hours per week to help students with assignments and answer questions.</li>

</ul>

<br />
<strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/golsp">Golsp</a></strong>: Interpreted, general purpose lisp-like programming language 
 <span class="small">(Fall 2018)</span>
<ul class="small">
<li>Implemented entirely in Go and itself.</li>
<li>Features a standard library that provides file I/O routines and an extensible module system.</li>
<li>Functional purity and Go runtime make it a good fit for concurrent applications.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<strong><a href="https://github.com/AjayMT/trash-detector">trash-detector</a></strong>: 36-hour hackathon project
 developed with two teammates <span class="small">(Spring 2019)</span>
<ul class="small">

<li>Convolutional neural network that detects trash (plastic bottles, crushed cans, etc.) in images.</Li>
<li>Gathered data manually (because of a lack of comprehensive trash datasets) to train network.</li>
<li>Connected the neural network to a web backend and exposed an API to scan and highlight trash in images.</li>
